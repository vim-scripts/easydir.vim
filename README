Using *easydir* is quite easy. Functionality remains the same for editing and
saving files, but now you can prepend nonexistent directories to the desired
file name to create them both.

EXAMPLES

:e new_directory/new_file.txt        Edits a file called |new_file.txt|
                                                      which is nested inside |new_directory|

:sp new_directory/new_file2.txt    Split a new window assign the file
                                                      as |new_file2.txt| and
                                                      create the directory |new_directory|

:n new_dir/another_dir/file.txt       You can even nest multiple directories!

That's it! So *easy!*
